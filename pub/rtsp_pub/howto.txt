### HOW TO BUILD IT UNDER WIN32

Compiler: minGW32
Platform: Windows32/64bit
Library: OpenSSL & Zlib are needed by libRTMP

Steps:
1. Install IDE with minGW compiler integrated (code::blocks)
2. Include following directories in the newly created project of IDE
   1) /pub/, /pub/rtsp_pub
   2) /live555/BasicUsageEnvironment, /live555/groupsock, /live555/liveMedia, /live555/UsageEnvironment
   3) /rtmpdump/librtmp
   4) path to the compiled DLLs of Openssl & Zlib along with header files
3. begin to compile source code (/pub/* use C++11)
4. check if all obj files are generated and start linking following files:
   1) all obj files
   2) compiled OpenSSL and Zlib DLLs and LIBs
   3) set link options needed by windows applications
      [1] -lws2_32 (win socket 2)
      [2] -lwinmm
5. link them all
